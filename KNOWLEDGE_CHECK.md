# Lab 08: Knowledge check

**Answer each question below it, in your own words, in one to three sentences.** Replace the `...` below **Your answer:** with your text. Questions 1 and 3 also ask for saved output, which goes into the directory `results/`.

## 1. Slurm: what jobs have I submitted?

**Your task:** print a history of all your Slurm job submissions *since November 4, 2026*. Format the output to include the job ID, job name, node list, partition, account, user, state, start time, and elapsed time. See the job accounting fields in the [sacct documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html). You may also ask Claude Code or another LLM for the exact command. 

Redirect the command's output to `results/job-history.txt` and include the file in your submission. Do not worry if some earlier jobs failed or were canceled. The complete history should show your process, including trial and error.

*Hint:* See [Part 1, Step 6](README.md#step-6-check-how-the-tasks-ended) in the README.

**Your answer:** Provide the entire command you used, including all CLI options.
mkdir -p results
sacct -S 2026-11-04 -X --format=JobId,JobName,NodeList,Partition,Account,User,State,Start,Elapsed > results/job-history.txt
cat results/job-history.txt

## 2. Slurm: did every array task run at the same time?

You submitted your entire job array with one `sbatch` command, but Slurm scheduled each task separately.

**Your task:** in the job history from Question 1, find the tasks from your most recent completed array run. Compare their start times and elapsed times.

*Hint:* See [Part 1, Step 5](README.md#step-5-watch-the-job-array) in the README.

**Your answer:** Did all tasks in the array start at the same time? Was the elapsed time identical for every task? Explain why or why not.
No, all tasks in the array did not start at the same time. Also, the elapsed time was not identical for every task. Most tasks took 12-16 s, but tasks 1-3 took 45 s. This is because summarize.py imports large libraries, read by the node from the file system (which is slow) but then for later tasks the libraries get stored in memory (which is faster). Also, the tasks start in groups because 3 GPU slices run at one time and the next group has to wait until slices are freed.

## 3. Slurm: did my job use what it asked for?

Suppose your next job array has 1,000 books instead of 101. Before you submit it, you want to know whether your script asks for too much or too little memory and time.

**Your task:** run `seff` for **one** task of your finished job array, and save its output as `results/seff.txt`.

*Hint:* `seff` takes the ID of one task, such as `4211873_1`. Compare its **Memory Utilized** and **Job Wall-clock time** with `--mem` and `--time` in your `summarize.slurm`.

**Your answer:** How much memory and time did the task use, compared with what your script asked for? What would you change in your script, and why?
Task 22811506_71 took 14 s and used 1.36 GB, compared to the 5 minutes and 16 GB outlined in summarize.slurm. The seff command also says there's only an 8.51% memory efficiency, so I would change the --mem to a much smaller number (like 5 GB to leave a margin incase a task uses more memory) to make it faster. For a run of 1000 books, this leaves more memory for other node users because the memory can be allocated to waiting time and scheduling.
